# American-Sign-Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). ASL is a complete, complex language that uses signs made by moving the hands combined with facial expressions and body postures. Recognizing these gestures through computer vision techniques can enable communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

## Features

- Train a CNN model to recognize ASL gestures.
- Real-time ASL gesture recognition.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
- Pretrained models available for quick deployment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
python ASD.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a large collection of labeled images representing various ASL gestures. Each image in the dataset corresponds to a specific ASL sign, allowing the CNN model to learn the visual features associated with each gesture. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure uniformity in image size, lighting conditions, and background noise, enhancing the model's ability to generalize.

## CNN Architecture

The CNN architecture employed in this project comprises multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction. These layers are designed to automatically learn discriminative features from input images, capturing spatial hierarchies and patterns crucial for ASL gesture recognition. Additionally, the architecture may include fully connected layers and softmax activation for final classification.
